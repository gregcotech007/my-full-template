# My very first website

Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

This website was created as part of my course I have undertaken with with Code Institute. As part of my learning journey in Fullstack Web Development program.

You can check out my website by clicking on the following link [here](https://gregcotech007.github.io/my-full-template/)!

## Project Description
This website was created to allow me to get familiar with common development tools such as Gitpod, GitHub and Git tools, etc. 

It allowed me to familiarise myself with the commands, creating backups and version controls. It has been very beneficial in supporting my learing journey on the course.

## Technology
This project was written in HTML and CSS using Gitpod and is currently hosted and backed up on Gitpod.
